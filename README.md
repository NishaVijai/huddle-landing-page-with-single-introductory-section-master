## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5
* CSS custom properties (variables)
* Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* Mobile-first workflow
* Responsive design principles

### What I learned

* How to structure a clean, mobile-first layout using **Flexbox and Grid**
* Using **CSS variables** for colors and spacing to improve maintainability
* Handling responsive background images for mobile and desktop
* Improving SVG icon styling using CSS
* Writing cleaner, more readable CSS for layout alignment and spacing

Example snippet:

```css
@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  main {
    flex-direction: row;
    gap: 3rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

* Improve desktop-first layout refinement
* Add smooth hover and focus states for accessibility
* Practice more complex responsive layouts
* Explore light JavaScript enhancements for UI interactions
